                The Rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
                learning (ML) technologies has significantly impacted Tourism 
                Management, leading to more personalized, efficient, and intelligent 
                systems for enhancing traveler experiences. Several studies have explored 
                the application of AI, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, 
                and data analytics to improve various aspects of tourism, including itinerary 
                planning, forecasting, recommendation systems, and cultural sensitivity.
                <br />
                <br />
                AI-driven systems have emerged as powerful tools for personalizing tourism experiences. 
                Research by Subasinghe et al. (2024) introduced "Solo Traveler," a location-based travel 
                forum that leverages NLP and ML to provide personalized travel advice and enhance safety 
                through real-time monitoring [13]. However, it lacks financial forecasting and emotional 
                analytics. Perera et al. (2018) proposed a sustainable tourism system using optimization 
                algorithms to manage tourist flow and reduce environmental impact, but it does not integrate 
                cultural or emotional aspects [14]. Nethmin et al. (2023) developed "TourBuddy," a data-driven 
                recommender system that offers personalized travel suggestions but lacks real-time event integration 
                [15].Legrand et al. (2022) introduced "TRIPORA," an ML-based system for real-time crowd monitoring 
                and tour guide suggestions, yet it misses comprehensive financial forecasting [16].
                <br />
                <br />
                The integration of AI and real-time data analytics holds significant potential for transforming tourism management. 
                However, existing research indicates challenges such as data fragmentation, lack of real-time event integration, 
                limited cultural sensitivity, and scalability issues that must be addressed to fully realize this potential.
